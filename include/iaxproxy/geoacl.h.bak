/*! \brief internal representation of acl entries
 * In principle user applications would have no need for this,
 * but there is sometimes a need to extract individual items,
 * e.g. to print them, and rather than defining iterators to
 * navigate the list, and an externally visible 'struct ast_ha_entry',
 * at least in the short term it is more convenient to make the whole
 * thing public and let users play with them.
